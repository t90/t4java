#summary t4 for java

= Introduction =

Microsoft introduced a nice concept in VS2005. t4 a template engine allows you to generate some code, xml or any other text-based compilation unit from ASP or PHP-like language.

Java has plenty of template engines but some are over-complicated and some 
just not powerful enough, or better say I was not able to find one that worked for me in my current project, so I decided to create one.
